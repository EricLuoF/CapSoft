# README

This is my (Eric Luo) submission for the Captivation Software coding challenge. 

## Usage

In order to run properly, this code needs to run on a Unix Operating system, or any system that can utilize 'stty'. 
to run:

Javac challenge.java
java challenge

## Troubleshooting

For this to be operational, it requires the usage of stty to have an unbuffered input flow. Although there is a shutdown hook to revert, doing 'stty cooked' will revert back to a buffered input stream.
